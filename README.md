# ErlyTalk - Messaging Service

It's a distributed WebSocket server in Erlang that handles incoming frames and dispatches them to the designated destination. It provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for real-time communication over WebSocket connections in a distributed environment.

- Messages between the Erlang nodes cluster are routed by the Distributed Erlang System.
- Usersâ€™ process IDs (PIDs) are stored and synchronized across the Erlang nodes cluster using Syn.
- The HTTP server is handled by Cowboy.
- New Erlang nodes are being discovered automatically by using Kubernetes headless service.
